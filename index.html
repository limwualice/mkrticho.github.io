				The tomato is a fruit native to South America, but is now grown and consumed all over the world. It is a staple ingredient in many cuisines 
				and is commonly used in salads, sauces, and soups. Tomatoes come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, yellow, and green, and can 
				be round, oblong, or even heart-shaped. They are low in calories but high in nutrients like vitamins C and K, potassium, and antioxidants. 
				While most people think of tomatoes as a vegetable, legally they are considered a fruit because they develop from the ovary in the base of 
				the flower and contain seeds. In addition to being delicious and healthy, tomatoes also have a fascinating history, having been believed to 
				be poisonous by Europeans until the 18th century.

				The WCW (World Championship Wrestling) and NWO (New World Order) rivalry was one of the most iconic storylines in professional wrestling 
				history. It began in 1996 when the NWO, led by Hulk Hogan, invaded WCW and turned it upside down. The NWO was portrayed as an outsider group 
				of renegade wrestlers who challenged the establishment represented by WCW. The storyline captured the attention of fans and propelled WCW to 
				new heights, resulting in a ratings war with the WWE (then WWF). The rivalry lasted for several years and saw many memorable matches and 
				moments, including the formation of various NWO factions and epic battles for championship titles.

				As a passionate volunteer with Hack for LA, I am actively involved in a project focused on visualizing parking data to drive understanding of the effects of parking policies on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis in the vibrant City of Los Angeles. 
				Leveraging my technical expertise, I have successfully connected a robust data pipeline to the API and seamlessly integrated Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Looker. 
				This collaborative effort aims to provide stakeholders with an intuitive platform that presents comprehensive parking data in a visually compelling manner.<br>
				By volunteering my skills and contributing to this project, I am playing a crucial role in empowering communities to make data-informed decisions regarding urban planning and transportation strategies. 
				Through the visualization of parking data, we aim to raise awareness, facilitate meaningful discussions, and drive positive change in the City of Los Angeles.<br><br>

            <p>I'm so excited to share my thesis with you, and I hope you'll find it as fun to read as I found it enjoyable to write! Let k be a field of characteristic 0. In this thesis, we show that the Hochschild cohomology of the family of short Gorenstein k-algebras

				sGor(N) =k[X_0,...,X_N](X_iX_j, X_i^2−X_j^2 | i,j= 0,...,N, i different from j), N≥2,
				
				exhibits exponential growth. The proof uses Gröbner-Shirshov basis theory and along the way we describe an explicit monomial basis for the Koszul dual of sGor(N) for N≥2.</p>
